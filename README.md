# MyVimConfig

This is my personal vim configuration, once run it will install all necessary programs to have neovim working on the machine. After the installation run neovim to install all the plug-ins though. I hope you like it if you try it.

## Programs to install if necessary

When you run the installer it will check whether or not you have the following programs installed, if you don't have them in you machine it will install them with no prompts.

- [neovim](https://neovim.io/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
- [node-js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >= 12.12

## How to use

Run

```
./installMyNvim
```
