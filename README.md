# MyVimConfig

This is my personal vim configuration, I hope you like it if you try it.

## Programs to install if necessary

When you run the installer it will check whether or not you have the following programs installed, if you don't have them in you machine it will install them with no promts except for node-js, in case it needs to be installed, it it will prompt for confirmation. 

- neovim

- git

- curl

- node-js

  

## How to use

Run

```
. installMyNvim
```

This will make sure your $HOME/bin is contained in $PATH which is necessary if neovim is to be installed using this repository

For not allowing the repository to edit your environment variables run

```
./installMyNvim 
```
